# Hello!

This is a python tool to make it easier to use the ~~god awful~~ Facebook API.

This tool simply takes a few parameters in the 'parameters.txt' file and will post on
the facebook page you desire!  
Alternatively, use the command set to make posts from a seperate script, or from the
console!
